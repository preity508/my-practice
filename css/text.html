<div class="overflw">Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse
    from a tame mouse at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio
    in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1925, Hugh Harman drew
    some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney.
    These inspired Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney.
    What is the moral of Mickey Mouse?
    The Mickey Mouse Short Story for Kids
    Even after being instructed by his mother,
    Mickey Mouse didn't keep his toys in place. Mickey
    was so busy playing with Minnie that he didn't listen
    to his mother, and his uncle tumbled over his toy and fell.
    Thus, the moral of the story is that we should always listen to
    our elders and must obey them.The actual story of Nobita was real story of a Japanese
    boy who suffered from Schizophrenia disease. Schizophrenia
    – A severe mental disorder which affects how a person thinks,
    behaves and feels. This disorder makes a person that they were
    not in real world which means they are living in an separate world.

    Doraemon comes from the future, and is with Nobita's
    great-great-grandson, Sewashi. He has a problem with heavy
    debt caused by the bankruptcy of Nobita's company. Sewashi came
    from the 22nd century to see Nobita to change the future, and he
    brought Doraemon to look after him.
