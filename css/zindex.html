    Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse
    from a tame mouse at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio
    in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1925, Hugh Harman drew
    some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney.
    These inspired Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney.
    What is the moral of Mickey Mouse?
    The Mickey Mouse Short Story for Kids
    Even after being instructed by his mother,
    Mickey Mouse didn't keep his toys in place. Mickey
    was so busy playing with Minnie that he didn't listen
    to his mother, and his uncle tumbled over his toy and fell.
    Thus, the moral of the story is that we should always listen to
    our elders and must obey them.

    Ratan Tata, in full Ratan Naval Tata, (born December 28, 1937, Bombay [now Mumbai], India), Indian businessman who
    became chairman (1991–2012 and 2016–17) of the Tata Group, a Mumbai-based conglomerate.
    
    A member of a prominent family of Indian industrialists and philanthropists (see Tata family), he was educated at
    Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, where he earned a B.S. (1962) in architecture before returning to work in India.
    He gained experience in a number of Tata Group businesses and was named director in charge (1971) of one of them, the
    National Radio and Electronics Co. He became chairman of Tata Industries a decade later and in 1991 succeeded his uncle,
    J.R.D. Tata, as chairman of the Tata Group.
    
    Upon assuming leadership of the conglomerate, Tata aggressively sought to expand it, and increasingly he focused on
    globalizing its businesses. In 2000 the group acquired London-based Tetley Tea for $431.3 million, and in 2004 it
    purchased the truck-manufacturing operations of South Korea’s Daewoo Motors for $102 million. In 2007 Tata Steel
    completed the biggest corporate takeover by an Indian company when it acquired the giant Anglo-Dutch steel manufacturer
    Corus Group for $11.3 billion.
    
    In 2008 Tata oversaw Tata Motors’ purchase of the elite British car brands Jaguar and Land Rover from the Ford Motor
    Company. The $2.3 billion deal marked the largest-ever acquisition by an Indian automotive firm. The following year the
    company launched the Tata Nano, a tiny rear-engined, pod-shaped vehicle with a starting price of approximately 100,000
    Indian rupees, or about $2,000. Although only slightly mor
